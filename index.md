I'm **James**. How's it going?  I hope your week is shaping up well.  

I'm a product person living and [working](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-hargreaves-9817b25b/) in Bristol.  I'm interested in a whole bunch of stuff - getting better at building digital products in awesome teams, the future of energy, electric vehicles, personal productivity, running up mountains, sitting on the sofa doing crosswords.

The motivation for this site came from the realisation that while I'm reading/watching/listening to a whole lot of stuff about the whole bunch of stuff I'm interested in, I'm not actively doing anything with it.  It's all consumption.  And it is starting to feel empty.

After coming across the idea of the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) via [How to Take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/) and various folks like [Nat Eliason](https://www.nateliason.com/) and [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/), and all [second](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/) [brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP3dA2GcAh8) folks, I'm trying to make better use of what I read & consume.

I'm not sure where this will take me, but to start I'll be putting my book reviews/notes here to a) keep me accountable and b) in the hope that someone might find them useful/interesting.

Cheerio!
